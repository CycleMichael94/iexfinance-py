All IEX EndPoints by Type
This is meant to be a master list of the available endpoints through IEX.
As FinMesh grows this is a sort of to-do list, although some of the premium data may never be supported fully due to cost.
At this point all of the bsic, non-premium endpoints except for some of the reference data should be fully supported.
